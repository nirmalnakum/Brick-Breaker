## Code Structure

The code is organized into several functions:

-   `gotoxy(int x, int y)`: Sets the cursor position in the console.
-   `setcursor(bool visible, DWORD size)`: Controls the visibility and size of the console cursor.
-   `setColor(int color)`: Sets the text color in the console.
-   `drawBorder()`: Draws the game boundaries.
-   `drawBricks()`: Draws the initial set of bricks.
-   `drawSlider()`: Draws the player's slider.
-   `eraseSlider()`: Erases the slider from its previous position.
-   `drawBall()`: Draws the game ball.
-   `eraseBall()`: Erases the ball from its previous position.
-   `drawScore()`: Displays the current score.
-   `drawLives()`: Displays the remaining lives.
-   `resetBallAndSlider()`: Resets the ball and slider to their starting positions.
-   `ballHitSlider()`: Handles ball collision with the slider.
-   `ballHitBrick()`: Handles ball collision with the bricks.
-   `play()`: Contains the main game loop.
-   `instructions()`: Displays the game instructions.
-   `main()`: The entry point of the program, handles the main menu.

## 🧱 Bricks

- **3 rows** of colored bricks:
  - Top row: Light Red
  - Middle row: Light Yellow
  - Bottom row: Light Green
- Bricks are removed upon collision with the ball
- Ball reflects vertically after hitting a brick

---

## ❤️ Lives System

- Player starts with **3 lives**
- Lose 1 life if the ball falls below the slider
- Game Over once all lives are lost
- Victory if all bricks are destroyed

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Logic Overview)

- The game initializes a 52×20 console screen with borders.
- Bricks are placed in a grid and tracked using a visibility array.
- Ball and slider positions are managed in a loop with collision checks.
- The ball moves in 4 diagonal directions (`dir` from 1 to 4).
- If the ball hits the slider, bricks, or wall, direction changes accordingly.
- Score and lives are updated dynamically.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Compile the code** using any Windows-compatible C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ brick_breaker.cpp -o brick_breaker
